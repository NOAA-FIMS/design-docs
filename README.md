# Design documents

As the Fisheries Integrated Modeling System (FIMS) is being developed, many choices must be made regarding how equations are parameterized and which features are included. Thus, this repository seeks to store markdown (or quarto) documents that summarize choices made in the design of FIMS. Currently, these design documents are first written in a Google Doc and then later translated into markdown.

The design document for length data was the first to be written in markdown from the onset and thus it is the first document that was posted here. More documents will come as we progress. Thank you to @JaneSullivan-NOAA for creating the original repository, which spurred the effort to create this form of long-term storage of this type of information.
